# React / Three.js Camera Movement Lab


3D navigation explored as structures accessed via programmatic first-person camera movements. 

These experiments use [Zustand](https://github.com/pmndrs/zustand) for state management, [react-spring](https://www.react-spring.io/) for animation, [react-three-fiber](https://github.com/pmndrs/react-three-fiber) for 3D (integrates [Three.js](https://threejs.org/))
