# React / Three.js Camera Movement Lab

![](scene-02.png?raw=true)

3D navigation explored as structures accessed via programmatic first-person camera movements.

Purpose is to explore the potential for a free, open source library of tools for controlling camera motion in highly configurable ways.

The first experiment uses Zustand for state management, react-spring for animation, react-three-fiber for 3D (integrates [Three.js](https://threejs.org/))

#### In Progress: Experiment 1 - Basic
Move from a central point through one of four routes. Switch routes by dollying through 3D space. 

#### Future: Experiment 2 - Zoom To / Through Cards
Explore a scattering of screens arranged in the manner of cards flung into 3D space.
