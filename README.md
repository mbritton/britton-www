# React Camera Movement Lab

![](scene-02.png?raw=true)

3D navigation explored as structures accessed via programmatic camera movements by a first-person camera.

Purpose is to explore the potential for a library of camera movement tools.

The first experiment uses Zustand for state management, react-spring for animation, react-three-fiber for 3D (integrates [Three.js](https://threejs.org/))
