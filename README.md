# React / Three.js Camera Movement Lab


3D navigation explored as structures accessed via programmatic first-person camera movements.

Purpose is to explore the potential for a free, open source library of tools for controlling camera motion in highly configurable ways.

The first experiment uses Zustand for state management, react-spring for animation, react-three-fiber for 3D (integrates [Three.js](https://threejs.org/))
